# NYU-SD-04 Milestone Project: Planning

I am making a quiz game! (inspiration came from "Are you smarter than a fifth grader?") 

--------

## Project Description

This game will consist of trivia questions, correct answers accumulate points to win. Player will be presented with a trivia question (history,geography,movies,etc) as well as four multiple choice answers. They must select one, and once selected, it will show if they are correct or incorrect. Player must get all questions correct to win the game.

## Game Logic
Player will be presented with home screen to start. Once they click the "start" button they will be presented with the first question, which they answer, see their result, and the correct answer as well. They move on to the next question, and so forth. 

## Deliverables

### MVP Criteria

- Create home with start button (add some cool CSS, maybe a sound effect when they click the start button).
- 10 trivia questions, with four multiple choice answers, one being the correct answer.
- If correct answer selected, correct will be displayed on the screen, vise versa if incorrect.'
-At end of game, show how many points they have based on how many questions they got correct.
-Maybe add a play again option..?

### Post-MVP Plans

- Hope to add some cool CSS in the main menu, and throughout the game
- Maybe add some sound effects, simple animations (correct answers gets a star animation, incorrect gets a red X animation)
- If player wins the game, a fun song/sound effect at the end, if player loses, a different type of song/sound effect.
